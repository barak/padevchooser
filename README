   [12]Version 0.9.2 released; initial release

Overview

   PulseAudio Device Chooser (padevchooser) is a simple GTK tool which
   registers an icon in the tray area and allows quick access to some
   features of the [13]PulseAudio sound server. Specifically it can do
   for you:
     * Notify about new sink/sources becoming available on the LAN
     * Quickly change the default PulseAudio sink/source/server assigned
       to the current X11 display, selecting devices available on the LAN
     * Start the auxiliary tools [14]PulseAudio Volume Control,
       [15]PulseAudio Volume Meter, [16]PulseAudio Manager,
       [17]PulseAudio Preferences

   Everybody loves [18]screenshots.

Current Status

   Works perfectly.

Documentation

   There is not much to say. Just run padevchooser and see for yourself.

Requirements

   Currently, padevchooser is tested on Linux only.

   padevchooser was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing"
   from June 2006, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and
   maybe Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf for source code
   configuration.

   padevchooser requires GTK 2.4, libnotify, GConf installed.

   Obviously padevchooser requires an installation of [19]PulseAudio
   (version 0.9.2), compiled with ZeroConf support. For being discovered
   correctly PulseAudio servers need to load module-zeroconf-publish and
   module-native-protocol-tcp.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of padevchooser.

Acknowledgements

   None so far.
